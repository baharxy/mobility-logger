	<string name="txt_welcomemessage"><small>This application shows and logs cellular network details provided by the Android API. 
		By pressing the Start button, the app begins to log all available information into a file on the sd-card. 
		\n\n This is a passive measurement app, hence you do not need an active data or voice connection for logging the information.
		However, if you decide to open the saved .kml file on your SD card through Google Earth you will be charged based on your data plan.
		\n\n<b>IMPORTANT NOTE!!!</b>:\nIn order to log signal strengths, the screen must remain on.
		Sadly by locking the screen (e.g. by pressing the power button) Andoid does not update any changes in the signal strengths.
		\n\n Thanks for your Cooperation!\n\n <i>Bahar</i></small></string>
